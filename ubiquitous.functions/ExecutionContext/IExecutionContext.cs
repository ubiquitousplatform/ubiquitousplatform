/* 

Features:
 - Create an instance of a runner
 - Runner should have a list of all functions and their versions
 - Each function+version should have a config (just like Lambda)
 - Store functions using ubiquitous.storage
 - Runtime for now will just be `deno run xxx`
 - Support input/output (from either Event system or from Background Runner)
  - Take inspiration from Lambda event format

Later
 - Enable default concurrency setting
